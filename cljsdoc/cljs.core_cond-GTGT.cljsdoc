===== Name
cljs.core/cond->>

===== Type
macro

===== Signature
[expr & clauses]

===== Description

Takes an expression and a set of test/form pairs. Threads `expr` (via `->>`)
through each form for which the corresponding test expression is true.

Note that, unlike `cond` branching, `cond->>` threading does not short circuit
after the first true test expression.
